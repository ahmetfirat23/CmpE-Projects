How to run the code:
1. Install numpy with `pip install numpy`
2. Run the code with `python3 2020400180.py <part>` where `<part>` is either `part1` or `part2`
3. The code will print the answer to the console and create results files


Part 2-3 and 3:
These parts are created in order to answer questions in the report. To run:
1. Uncomment all comments in the code
2. Install tqdm and interruptingcow with `pip install tqdm interruptingcow`
(these are used to measure the time it takes to run the code and to interrupt the code if it takes too long)
3. Run the code with `python3 2020400180.py <part>` where `<part>` is either `part2-3` or `part3`
